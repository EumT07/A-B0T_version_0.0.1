# A-B0T_version_0.0.1
A-Bot is just a simple bot to help me control my time work, I'm using the selenium module in order to access the page with my email and password and run the code And I built a desktop app with tkinter in order to have a interface to execute my code and make this a little friendly.  This is a little project to test or improve my knowledge skills with Python

This code does not use malicious code, nor does it take personal data for any inappropriate use, but for the effective use of the bot you must establish an email and a password, which will be used on the Bamboohr page, such information is only stored locally in the "/db" databases so that the bot performs its operation correctly, The function of the bot is simple, this login in your account and run the counter according to the time that the user establishes, this time only serves to keep track of the work schedule.
